# Sponge Street workspace

A structural vertical slice for SpongeSquad: one synthetic street, one rain garden, explicit water connections, and a conserved water balance. React owns controls; TypeScript owns the world and simulation; one Phaser scene renders the results. No bitmap swaps or external art are required.

## Run

Requires Node 22.18+ (tested with Node 24) and npm.

```sh
cd street-workspace
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Build with `npm run build`; run model checks with `npm test`.

## A 60-second demo

1. Run rain on the sealed street. All water reaches the sewer.
2. Add a rain garden. It receives only rain on its own footprint; street runoff bypasses it.
3. Connect street runoff and run rain again. Storage fills, infiltration goes to soil, and overflow goes to the drain.
4. Compare baseline at the same storm minute. Scrub the timeline to inspect changes.
5. Click a zone or use the zone buttons to inspect its identity, material, area and parking count. Reset restores the original scenario.

The default storm is 30 mm over 30 minutes on 1,800 m². Its final balances are:

| State            | Rain | Stored | Infiltrated | Sewer |
| ---------------- | ---: | -----: | ----------: | ----: |
| Sealed           | 54.0 |    0.0 |         0.0 |  54.0 |
| Isolated garden  | 54.0 |    1.6 |         2.0 |  50.4 |
| Connected garden | 54.0 |   12.0 |         2.0 |  40.0 |

All volumes are m³. These are illustrative assumptions, not calibrated Basel performance. Stored water is the amount remaining at the end of the event, not a permanent reduction. No post-storm drain-down is simulated.

## Where changes belong

| File                   | Responsibility                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/types.ts`         | Zones, surfaces, assets, hydrological nodes, edges, plans and snapshots    |
| `src/scenario.ts`      | Six rectangular zones and baseline drainage graph; metric geometry         |
| `src/interventions.ts` | Pure baseline → plan → world transformation; dependency check              |
| `src/simulation.ts`    | Graph validation, topological routing and one-minute water balances        |
| `src/WorldView.tsx`    | One Phaser scene: geometry, assets, arrows, water and selection events     |
| `src/main.tsx`         | React controls, playback, comparison, inspector and model boundaries       |
| `test/model.test.ts`   | Conservation, connectivity, overflow, invalid graphs and evidence boundary |

This is a concrete case, not a generic city engine. The rain-garden compiler deliberately targets the demo parking strip. Add the second intervention only after testing this interaction with people.

## Boundaries with the other work

### Andy's site scoping

Inspected `andymucyo-ops/Hack-am-Rhein-2026-SpongeSquad`, `feature/hot-spot-map`, commit `ae0f8fc3cc44d380ee2e5b44e00e95f9b546eb6b` on 2026-10-03. `CandidateSiteContext` is a structural subset of the existing `CandidateArea` type. The factory accepts that context and preserves sources, missing evidence and constraints:

```ts
const scenario = createDemoStreet(candidateArea);
```

This is a typed integration seam, not a wired map-to-workspace flow. It does not turn area indicators into site geometry, soil permeability or drainage facts. The shipped UI uses a synthetic scenario with no selected site. Andy's app remains on its existing branch.

### Achim's Sponge Street explainer

The original `prototypes/sponge-street` is retained unchanged. This slice implements the meaning of `park:1` (rain garden) and `road:1` (open kerb, requiring a garden). It does **not** reuse the explainer's percentage deltas: applying those on top of routed water would double-count effects. Its twelve-state ladder and other tracks remain in the explainer.

### Uploaded Phaser v5

Reviewed `basel-sponge-phaser-v5.zip`: retains the useful single-scene / DOM-controls division, but replaces whole-image state swaps with typed geometry and individual assets. No uploaded image or script is copied into this implementation. The original upload remains available independently.

## Simulation contract

- Each catchment contributes `areaM2 × depthMm / 1000` over the event.
- Catchment and conveyance nodes have exactly one flow outlet. Storage nodes have infiltration-to-soil and overflow outlets. Soil and sewer are sinks.
- Graphs must be acyclic; missing references, duplicate IDs and ambiguous splits are rejected.
- Every minute, available storage water infiltrates up to the rate allowance, then excess above capacity overflows. Node processing follows graph order.
- At every snapshot: `rain = stored + infiltrated + sewer` within floating-point tolerance.
- Edge volumes are cumulative throughput, **not** additive water destinations. Visual particles indicate an edge was active in the current step; particle counts/speeds are not physical measurements.
- Rectangles are in metres. Screen projection is separate. Assets reference their hydrological node; selection never mutates simulation state.
- One 120 m² strip changes material and loses three illustrative parking spaces. Its spatial zone retains its original identity/type; the intervention does not rename the zone into an asset.
- Baseline and intervention plans are immutable inputs. Recompilation from baseline makes removal/reset exact.

Uniform rain, no evaporation, no travel time, no sewer capacity limit, no groundwater or soil saturation and no heat model. Storms reset to empty storage. Site ownership stays unknown. These limits are visible in the UI.

## Deliberately deferred

Map navigation integration, real-site geometry, further intervention tracks, ownership/decision pathways, engineered hydrology, art assets and deployment. None is implied by the illustrative model.

## Verification on 2026-10-03

- Nine model tests pass, including conservation across 72 event/configuration combinations.
- TypeScript check and Vite production build pass. Phaser produces a large bundle (about 406 kB gzip); code splitting is deferred.
- Existing Sponge Street smoke test passes unchanged.
- Headless Chromium checks pass: canvas loads without runtime errors; add/connect/compare/disconnect/reset; playback advances and pauses; 390 px layout has no horizontal overflow. Desktop and mobile screenshots were visually inspected.
- No map navigation, deployment, or real-site calibration is claimed.
